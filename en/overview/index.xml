This is a simple example; a failed rule, an incomplete rule and other secondary scenarios are reserved for other examples. Currently the Overlord PoC is focused on viability so it develops just the &amp;ldquo;Happy Path&amp;rdquo;.
The complete log is also excluded from this example, because due to its length it would be very complex to explain in detail.</description></item></channel></rss>
