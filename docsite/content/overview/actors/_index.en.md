In this documentation section we are going to give a perspective from different points of view familiar to users who can benefit from Overlord.

Being a tool that covers a universal scenario, we have realized that users tend to see it from their personal point of view, and it is a bit difficult for them to take the "universal" step. Because of this we will use a familiar scenario and then expand that perspective to try to describe Overlord.
