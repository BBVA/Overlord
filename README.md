Overlord
========

Overlord is an example POC of [SUSTO](https://github.com/BBVA/susto) leading
concept. Be aware that Overlord is not on a functional state.

Current POC includes a metaphor about live searching programatic complex graph.
In this graph edges are compex pieces of code that can provide information or
requirements.

Using this mechanism a complex process of information harvest emerge from
simple pieces of code. Providing a secure way to share code but not bussiness
logic about it.

This mechanism is called Atomic code graph. And we belive that will ease
security information harvest.

SUSTO requires more technological concepts, so stay tuned to learn more.
